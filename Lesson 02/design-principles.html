                    <p>This website is an excellent example of using white and clean space. In the large view, the first
                        thing you see is the centered header, with nice and open space before you hit the navigation on
                        the top right of the page. Just beneath that header is where the content begins. The white space
                        keeps the image clean while still drawing your attention to the content. When you switch it into 
                        mobile view. It's pretty much the same thing. Beautiful content without strain on the eye.</p>

                    <p>The way this site shows the rule of thirds is probably more in a photographic style possibly.
                        The design is easily split into thirds as far as how the columns and images are laid out as well as 
                        the largest picture of them all being placed in the bottom left corner which is also a rule in 
                        photography. When in a mobile view. It still maintains a look of being divided into three parts.</p>

                    <p>Of the examples of sites I visit, this one is a perfect specimen to show off some of the best of 
                        contrast. A dark background with some darker imagery, and to contrast that, the ext is all white and
                        so it's completely legible without detracting from the cool image behind. The text pops out at you and
                        immediately snags your attention to the true purpose of the website, whether it be learning a skill or 
                        doing some shopping. Just look at the logo even!</p>
